dev-log #1 10/27/2023

Created Dockerfile that runs on an image of linux called alpine, then installed nodejs. then made a simple script to test
whether or not nodejs works. it did work however i've just started and what i have done seems pretty basic in nature. I have just started a simple nodejs server that runs on a local port that one can go to and see the text "hello world" on the page. The port was originally 3000 when tested, but has since changed port to 8000 because of preference. there is some more research to be done whats the best practices regarding docker. ive read a good chuck of the docker docs forms to get a good sense of what is expected but i shall continue to read and reasearch things that would be benificial to this project. end
