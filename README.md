dev-log #1 10/27/2023

Created a Dockerfile that runs on an image of Linux called Alpine, then installed Nodejs. then made a simple script to test
whether or not Bodejs works. it did work however I've just started and what I have done seems pretty basic in nature. I have just started a simple Nodejs server that runs on a local port that one can go to and see the text "hello world" on the page. The port was originally 3000 when tested but has since changed the port to 8000 because of preference. there is some more research to be done whats the best practices regarding docker. I've read a good chunk of the docker docs forms to get a good sense of what is expected but I shall continue to read and research things that would be beneficial to this project. good initial push.
